= Demo for testing mTLS in Confluent Cloud

This demonstrates how to use mTLS in Confluent Cloud

DISCLAIMER: This project is for demonstration purposes only. Using the demo unmodified in production is highly discouraged. Use at your own risk.


Set/customize some variables by copying `terraform.tfvars.template` to `terraform.tfvars`.

If you start from scratch, initialize terraform once:

```shell
terraform init
```

Check the plan generated by terraform:

```shell
terraform plan
```

If you agree with the plan, deploy the resources (that will take some time):

```shell
terraform apply
```

== Testing the setup

TODO


== Wrapping things up

You can destroy all created resources including the cluster in Confluent Cloud by running the following command:

```shell
terraform destroy
```
